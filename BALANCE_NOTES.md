## Balance Targets (8-round campaign)

- Population Units: 10–14
- Census: ~65,000–110,000
- Developed tiles: 8–12
- Upgraded tiles: 2–3+
- All 4 sectors present by Round 5

Poorly played:
- Stalls by Round 5–6
- Ends below ~45,000 census
- Clear limiter (jobs/services/roads/mission)

## Growth Contract

Growth is determined by potential residents, job capacity, and services capacity. Only road-connected development contributes. Missions modify growth but do not replace structural needs. The board state is the primary driver; suits accelerate or stall it.

## Planning Focus (companion only)
- Per-round optional input: Auto (default) or pick RES/COM/INF/CIV.
- On resolve, the first build action tries that sector (road-adjacent legal build/upgrade); if unavailable, normal rules apply.
